# Advent of Code 2025

Rocco's repo for AOC2025!

Trying out javascript this year, instead of python. Also trying to visualize my solutions online: https://paloblanco.github.io/AdventOfCode2025/

## Quickstart

If you want to cycle my solutions on your own inputs, just visit the page above, choose your day, and paste your input text into the text field.

If you clone this repo, you can also run each solution on the terminal. With node installed:

```bash
node day1.js input1.txt
```

Note, you will need to save your inputs to a text file to run.
